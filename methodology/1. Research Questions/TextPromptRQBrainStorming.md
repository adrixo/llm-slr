# Prompt for brainstorming the research questions

You are a expert researcher in the field of recommender systems and you are tasked with brainstorming the research questions for a systematic literature review (SLR) on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems. The goal is to identify the main research questions that should be addressed in the SLR.

Answer with posible research questions in a structured way. First, you should provide the research question, next, you should provide a brief explanation about it.


## ChatGPT o1-preview response:

- **RQ1**: What are the current applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems?

Explanation: This question aims to identify and categorize the various ways LLMs are being utilized within recommender systems, such as for personalized content generation, user preference modeling, or enhancing item descriptions.

- **RQ2**: How do LLM-based recommender systems perform compared to traditional recommendation algorithms in terms of accuracy and user satisfaction?

Explanation: This question investigates whether incorporating LLMs leads to measurable improvements in recommendation quality, accuracy, and overall user satisfaction when compared to conventional methods.

- **RQ3**: What methodologies are employed to integrate LLMs into existing recommender system architectures?

Explanation: This question explores the different technical approaches for incorporating LLMs, such as fine-tuning pre-trained models, using embeddings, or combining LLMs with collaborative filtering techniques.

- **RQ4**: What are the challenges and limitations associated with using LLMs in recommender systems?

Explanation: This question seeks to uncover potential obstacles like computational costs, scalability issues, data requirements, and the complexity of training and deploying LLMs in recommendation contexts.

- **RQ5**: How does the use of LLMs impact the explainability and transparency of recommender systems?

Explanation: This question examines whether LLMs make it easier or harder to provide transparent and interpretable recommendations, which is crucial for user trust and regulatory compliance.

- **RQ6**: What ethical considerations arise from applying LLMs in recommender systems, particularly concerning bias and fairness?

Explanation: This question addresses concerns about how biases inherent in LLMs might affect recommendation outcomes and what measures can be taken to ensure fairness and ethical standards.

- **RQ7**: In what ways do LLMs enhance personalization and user experience in recommender systems?

Explanation: This question explores how LLMs contribute to more personalized recommendations by better understanding user context, preferences, and natural language inputs.

- **RQ8**: What are the computational and resource implications of deploying LLMs in recommender systems at scale?

Explanation: This question investigates the resource requirements for training and serving LLMs within recommender systems, including processing power, memory, and potential cost implications.

- **RQ9**: How effective are LLMs in handling multilingual and cross-cultural recommendation scenarios?

Explanation: This question looks into the capability of LLMs to understand and process multiple languages, thereby improving recommendations in a globalized user base.

- **RQ10**: What future research directions are suggested for the integration of LLMs in recommender systems?

Explanation: This question aims to identify gaps in the current literature and propose areas for future investigation, such as real-time recommendation, continual learning, or enhanced user interaction models.
