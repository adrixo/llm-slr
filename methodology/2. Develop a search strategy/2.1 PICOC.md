PICOC for the Systematic Literature Review on the Application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in Recommender Systems

- **Population (P)**:
Recommender Systems: Systems designed to provide personalized suggestions or content to users across various domains such as e-commerce, media streaming, social networks, and education.

- **Intervention (I)**:
Application of Large Language Models (LLMs): The integration or utilization of LLMs (e.g., GPT-3, BERT, T5) within recommender systems to enhance recommendation capabilities, including understanding user preferences, generating recommendations, or improving interaction.

- **Comparison (C)**:
Traditional Approaches: Recommender systems employing conventional methods without LLMs, such as collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, matrix factorization, or other machine learning techniques.

- **Outcome (O)**:
Performance and Impact Metrics: Evaluation of how LLM integration affects system performance, including metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, diversity, novelty, serendipity, user satisfaction, computational efficiency, and scalability.

- **Context (C)**:
Research and Application Settings: Studies conducted in academic, industrial, or real-world environments focusing on the intersection of LLMs and recommender systems, published in peer-reviewed journals, conferences, or reputable industry reports within a specified timeframe (e.g., 2018 onwards to capture recent advancements).
