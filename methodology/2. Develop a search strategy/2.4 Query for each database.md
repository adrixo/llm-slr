# Prompt for brainstorming the query for each database

You are a expert researcher in the field of recommender systems and you are tasked with brainstorming the query for each database in a systematic literature review (SLR) on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems. The goal is to identify the main research questions that should be addressed in the SLR.

Generate a query with the followings terms:

- The term “llm” or “large language model” to search for large language models related works.
- The term “recommender”, “recsys”, to search for papers presenting recommendation algorithms.
- Consider alternative: Terms such as names of famous llms such as "gpt", "llama", "mistral", etc.
- Other terms such as “consumer hardware”, “limitations”, “issues”, “efficient”, “activity” that refer to the research questions proposed.


For each database:

- IEEE Xplore
- Web of Science
- SpringerLink
- Scopus

Answer with the query string for each database and its respective sintaxis and explanation.


## ChatGPT o1-preview response:


**IEEE Xplore**

**Query:**
```
(("llm" OR "large language model" OR "gpt" OR "llama" OR "mistral") AND ("recommender" OR "recsys") AND ("consumer hardware" OR "limitations" OR "issues" OR "efficient" OR "activity"))
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks ("")**: Used to search for exact phrases.
- **Parentheses ()**: Group terms to control the logical operation order.
- **OR**: Retrieves records containing any of the terms it separates.
- **AND**: Retrieves records containing all the terms it connects.
  
This query searches for articles that mention any of the specified LLM terms **and** any of the recommender system terms **and** any of the additional terms related to the research questions. The search is performed across all metadata fields by default, including the title, abstract, and keywords.

**Web of Science**

**Query:**
```
TS=(("llm" OR "large language model" OR "gpt" OR "llama" OR "mistral") AND ("recommender" OR "recsys") AND ("consumer hardware" OR "limitations" OR "issues" OR "efficient" OR "activity"))
```

**Explanation:**

- **TS=**: Specifies that the search is within the Topic field (Title, Abstract, Author Keywords, and Keywords Plus).
- **Quotation Marks ("")**: Used for exact phrase searches.
- **Parentheses ()**: Used to group terms logically.
- **OR** and **AND**: Standard Boolean operators to expand or restrict the search.

This query retrieves records where the Topic field contains any of the LLM terms **and** any of the recommender system terms **and** any of the additional specified terms.

**SpringerLink**

**Query:**
```
("llm" OR "large language model" OR "gpt" OR "llama" OR "mistral") AND ("recommender" OR "recsys") AND ("consumer hardware" OR "limitations" OR "issues" OR "efficient" OR "activity")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Quotation Marks ("")**: Enclose exact phrases to be matched.
- **Parentheses ()**: Group terms to define the order of operations.
- **OR**: Broadens the search to include any of the terms.
- **AND**: Narrows the search to include records that contain all specified groups of terms.

SpringerLink supports basic Boolean searches across the full text and metadata. This query ensures that all three groups of terms are represented in the search results.

**Scopus**

**Query:**
```
TITLE-ABS-KEY(("llm" OR "large language model" OR "gpt" OR "llama" OR "mistral") AND ("recommender" OR "recsys") AND ("consumer hardware" OR "limitations" OR "issues" OR "efficient" OR "activity"))
```

**Explanation:**

- **TITLE-ABS-KEY()**: Limits the search to the Title, Abstract, and Keywords fields.
- **Quotation Marks ("")**: Used for searching exact phrases.
- **Parentheses ()**: Organize terms and control the search logic.
- **OR** and **AND**: Boolean operators to combine search terms.

This query fetches documents where the Title, Abstract, or Keywords contain any of the LLM terms **and** any of the recommender system terms **and** any of the additional specified terms.

---

**Overall Explanation:**

In each database, the query is structured to find scholarly articles that meet the following criteria:

1. **LLM Terms**: The article mentions "llm", "large language model", or names of well-known LLMs such as "gpt", "llama", or "mistral".

2. **Recommender System Terms**: The article includes terms like "recommender" or "recsys" to ensure it relates to recommendation algorithms.

3. **Additional Terms**: The article discusses aspects related to "consumer hardware", "limitations", "issues", "efficient", or "activity", aligning with the research questions of the SLR.

By using database-specific syntax and field codes, the queries are optimized to retrieve the most relevant literature for your systematic review.
