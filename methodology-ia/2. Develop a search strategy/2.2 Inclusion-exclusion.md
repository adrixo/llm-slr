# Inclusion-exclusion criteria

You are a expert researcher in the field of recommender systems and you are tasked with developing the inclusion-exclusion criteria for a systematic literature review (SLR) on the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems. The goal is to identify the main research questions that should be addressed in the SLR.

You are using the PICOC framework to define the scope of the SLR and the inclusion-exclusion criteria to identify the research papers that should be included in the SLR.

Answer with the inclusion-exclusion criteria in a structured way. First, you should provide the inclusion-exclusion criteria.
